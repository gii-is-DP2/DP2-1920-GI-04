### Manhours spent

Day | Hours | Description | Asignee
--- | ----- |------------ | -------
22/02 | 5 | Brainstorming, project introduction, entities involved and 2 user stories | Youssef San José Khamer
01/03 | 5 | 18 user stories, use cases for 11 user stories, sprint plannings | Youssef San José Khamer
01/03 | 1.5 | Use cases for the 9 user stories left, sprint retrospectives update | Youssef San José Khamer

### Final Thoughts

As initially planned, the best case scenario would have been to finish before the first laboratory lesson and have all doubts resolved in that session, but it was impossible to achieve due to lack of time. In order to avoid this, the next sprint will be started immediately, aiming to finish a week before the delivery date.

When finishing by 24/2 was deemed as not possible, finishing the project by 02/03 was accomplished with no problems and no major doubts. In spite of that, it would be advisable to finish earlier even if the 1-week-earlier goal is not met.

Both major thoughts involve spending the most amount of manhours early in the sprint to finish with plenty of time for asking doubts and make changes. Depending on how the next weeks go by, maybe the sprint planning will be scheduled ahead to assure success on future sprints.

### Final Thoughts

While none of the objectives have been met, due to lack of time, focusing on climbing the learning curve was the main focus on this deliverable as soon as it was deemed as not possible to fully accomplish. Having all the required knowledge and feedback to easily complete the rest of the deliverable will be needed during the following weeks in order to rapidly catch up.

Also, during this sprint documentation steps, the fact that aiming to 9 points required consuming an external API was noticed, thus leading on a lowerage on the aim from 9 points to 8.

In case external factors would take up crucial time again, a further lowerage of the aim should be considered, but there is confidence of that not happening. The only risky factor will be the newly introduced concepts (performance tests), so learning about them early during the final sprint will be crucial to have a proper understanding of the current development progress and time left.
