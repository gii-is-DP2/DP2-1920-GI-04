# DP2 GI-04 - Sprint Retrospectives

This document will be used to state the evaluation level aimed, breakdown of accomplished objectives, manhours spent by each collaborator and some final thoughts


## Sprint 1 - March 02

### Evaluation level aimed

Level 2 application -> Up to 9 points evaluation level

### Accomplished objectives

* Project introduction - Youssef San José Khamer
* Entities involved - Youssef San José Khamer
* User Stories - Youssef San José Khamer
* Use Cases - Youssef San José Khamer
* Sprint Plannings - Youssef San José Khamer
* Sprint Retrospectives update - Youssef San José Khamer

### Manhours spent

Day | Hours | Description | Asignee
--- | ----- |------------ | -------
22/02 | 5 | Brainstorming, project introduction, entities involved and 2 user stories | Youssef San José Khamer
01/03 | 5 | 18 user stories, use cases for 11 user stories, sprint plannings | Youssef San José Khamer
01/03 | 1.5 | Use cases for the 9 user stories left, sprint retrospectives update | Youssef San José Khamer

### Final Thoughts

As initially planned, the best case scenario would have been to finish before the first laboratory lesson and have all doubts resolved in that session, but it was impossible to achieve due to lack of time. In order to avoid this, the next sprint will be started immediately, aiming to finish a week before the delivery date.

When finishing by 24/2 was deemed as not possible, finishing the project by 02/03 was accomplished with no problems and no major doubts. In spite of that, it would be advisable to finish earlier even if the 1-week-earlier goal is not met.

Both major thoughts involve spending the most amount of manhours early in the sprint to finish with plenty of time for asking doubts and make changes. Depending on how the next weeks go by, maybe the sprint planning will be scheduled ahead to assure success on future sprints.

16/05 | 1 | Sprint Retrospectives update (after the due date) | Youssef San José Khamer

### Final Thoughts

While none of the objectives have been met, due to lack of time, focusing on climbing the learning curve was the main focus on this deliverable as soon as it was deemed as not possible to fully accomplish. Having all the required knowledge and feedback to easily complete the rest of the deliverable will be needed during the following weeks in order to rapidly catch up.

Also, during this sprint documentation steps, the fact that aiming to 9 points required consuming an external API was noticed, thus leading on a lowerage on the aim from 9 points to 8.

In case external factors would take up crucial time again, a further lowerage of the aim should be considered, but there is confidence of that not happening. The only risky factor will be the newly introduced concepts (performance tests), so learning about them early during the final sprint will be crucial to have a proper understanding of the current development progress and time left.

### Final Thoughts

In spite of the workload delay in previous sprints, the final sprint served for being able to finally finish everything. Properly assessing the time needed for learning how implement the new theory lessons was key to achieving this, taking the lessons before doing any pending task.

However there was a lesson that wasn't properly assessed until the time came to implement it. I did watch and understand the lesson on 'profiling', but didn't put it to test until the last day since it seemed very easy to configure. However, it was impossible to make Glowroot work properly. It would get to be deployed, but it wouldn't capture any of the actions done on the system. This mistake, so late in the sprint, could have been fatal; but rapidly changing the approach to trying out JavaMelody solved the situation.

Even though everything was accomplished, I would have liked to take more care into the code and do more refactorings to make everything more understandable, but the main proble throughtout the whole project was not having enough time to do everything.
Nonetheless, the final sprint has served to finally catch up to the past two sprints' delays, finishing the project successfully.
