### Final Thoughts

As initially planned, the best case scenario would have been to finish before the first laboratory lesson and have all doubts resolved in that session, but it was impossible to achieve due to lack of time. In order to avoid this, the next sprint will be started immediately, aiming to finish a week before the delivery date.

When finishing by 24/2 was deemed as not possible, finishing the project by 02/03 was accomplished with no problems and no major doubts. In spite of that, it would be advisable to finish earlier even if the 1-week-earlier goal is not met.

Both major thoughts involve spending the most amount of manhours early in the sprint to finish with plenty of time for asking doubts and make changes. Depending on how the next weeks go by, maybe the sprint planning will be scheduled ahead to assure success on future sprints.
